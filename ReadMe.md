# Rota-Fortunae

This is a .NET Blazor project that demonstrates my FortuneWheel component.

I did this as a proof of concept for a project on UpWork that I decided to pass on.  

The project demonstrates it is possible to render a "Wheel of Fortune" like wheel, with a dynamic number of slots.  It spins a random number of times and returns the winner back to the parent component.  The interesting thing about this project is that no JavaScript or third party packages or libraries were used to create this.  It is pure HTML, CSS, and Blazor.
